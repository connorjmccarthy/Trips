    dict(id='bq3', question='Who is actually riding, and does everyone have an IDP?',
         why='This is the one that can genuinely ruin the trip. Since April 2026 Bali has run a zero-tolerance policy on foreign riders, and at a checkpoint you need the physical International Driving Permit booklet with the motorcycle "A" stamp, alongside your normal licence and the bike papers. A photo on your phone does not count. The fine is a few hundred thousand rupiah per missing document, which is annoying. The real cost is that riding unlicensed voids nearly every Australian travel insurance policy, so a crash becomes a six-figure medical bill that nobody covers.',
         options=['Everyone rides, everyone gets an IDP with the A stamp before we go',
                  'Only the confident riders take scooters; the rest use Grab and share cars',
                  'No scooters at all; Grab, Gojek and a driver for the week'],
         recommendation='Get the IDPs. They are about A$50 from the RACQ, take a few days, and last a year. If anyone has never ridden a scooter before, Bali in the wet season is a genuinely bad place to learn: Grab and Gojek are cheap, everywhere, and about Rp15,000 to Rp30,000 for a hop across Canggu.'),
    dict(id='bq5', question='Is the Nusa Penida day actually booked?',
         why='Bluuu Tours is on the plan for Saturday the 7th but there is no confirmation recorded anywhere. It is the biggest single thing anyone pays for on the trip, and Saturday boats sell out.',
         options=['Booked already', 'Not booked yet', 'Not doing it'],
         recommendation='If it is not booked, do it now for five. The shared boat with the free Canggu van pickup is the good-value option, and Saturdays go first.'),
    dict(id='bq6', question='Does anyone want to swap a day for something else?',
         why='The week as it stands: settle in on Thursday, Seminyak and Kuta on Friday, Nusa Penida on Saturday, a slow Canggu day Sunday, FINNS on Monday, and the big driver day north on Tuesday. That leaves the two heaviest days, the boat and the driver, with lighter days on either side, which is deliberate. Things that did not make the cut and easily could: Uluwatu and the kecak fire dance at sunset, a day trip to the Gili islands, Ubud and the monkey forest, or a cooking class.',
         options=['The week is good as it is', 'Swap something for Uluwatu and the kecak dance', 'Swap something for a cooking class or a spa day', 'Something else, say so in the group chat'],
         recommendation='Leave it. Six days is not many and the current shape already has two big days out plus a beach club. Uluwatu is the one genuine gap, and it would work as an evening instead of the Sunday sunset if enough people want it.'),

    dict(title='Warung, cafe, restaurant: knowing which is which',
         body='A warung is a small family-run place, often open-fronted, doing Indonesian food for Rp30,000 to Rp70,000 a plate. A Canggu "cafe" is a Western-facing operation charging Rp80,000 to Rp180,000 for brunch. A beach club is four to six times warung prices. The food at a good warung is usually better than the cafe next door, and the gap between eating mostly at one or mostly at the other adds up over a week. Nasi campur, rice with a selection of small dishes, is the thing to order when you cannot decide.'),
    dict(title='Not getting sick',
         body='The rules that actually matter: never drink the tap water and do not use it to brush your teeth; ice in established cafes and restaurants is factory-made and fine, ice from a street cart is not; eat at places with turnover, because food that has been sitting is the problem rather than food that is cheap. Fresh juice made in front of you is fine, pre-made juice is a coin flip. Carry rehydration sachets and Imodium, because the odds over a week are not in your favour and the difference between a ruined day and a ruined trip is having them with you.'),
    dict(title='Paying, tipping and prices',
         body='Card works in cafes, restaurants, beach clubs and supermarkets; warungs, markets, drivers and temple entries are cash. Many places add a "plus plus" of 10% service and 11% tax to the menu price, so a Rp100,000 dish is Rp121,000; the menu usually says so in small print. Tipping is not expected but is normal now in tourist areas: round up, or Rp20,000 to Rp50,000 for good service, Rp100,000 for a driver who has had you all day.'),
    dict(title='Eating as a group of five',
         body='Five is an awkward number for small warungs and a good number for everywhere else. Book ahead for dinner anywhere popular in Canggu from about 7pm, because the good places fill up and walk-ins wait. Ordering family-style and splitting the bill is normal and nobody will blink at one card paying and everyone squaring up later. Beach clubs run wristband tabs, which is the easiest way for five people to lose track, so nominate someone to hold the tab.'),

STAYS_GUIDE = [

         body='Canggu, and specifically Tibubeneng and Berawa, which is the quieter northern end. Flat, coastal, young and loud: surf, beach clubs, scooters, cafes, and a traffic problem that gets worse every year. Everything on this plan except the Tuesday driver day and the Friday run to Seminyak and Kuta is within about ten minutes of the villa.'),
    dict(title='What a Bali villa is and is not',
         body='A private villa for five is usually cheaper per head than hotel rooms and comes with a pool, a kitchen and often staff who clean daily. What it does not come with: reliable hot water pressure, a lift, or anyone at the desk at 1am. That is why the midnight arrival needs telling them in advance. Ask about luggage storage on the check-out day, whether a late check-out is buyable, and whether they will arrange a driver, because villa staff almost always have a cousin who drives and the price will beat a booking site.'),
    dict(title='November in Bali',
         body='The start of the wet season. Days sit around 27 to 30 degrees with humidity above 85%. Rain comes in short heavy afternoon bursts rather than all day: about 10 to 13 wet days in the month and 145mm total, so more than half the days stay dry. Plan outdoor things for the morning and let the afternoon look after itself. On the west coast the surf is smaller and the wind more variable than mid-year, which suits beginners, and the tide starts bringing debris onto the Canggu and Seminyak beaches, which is seasonal and normal. Mosquitoes arrive with the rain, so repellent from day one.'),
    dict(title='Getting around',
         body='Scooters are the default and the fastest way around Canggu, with all the licence caveats on the Checklists page. Grab and Gojek are the alternative and are cheap: about Rp15,000 to Rp30,000 for a hop across Canggu, more in traffic. Both apps do cars as well as bikes, which is the answer after a drink or in the rain. For anything more than half an hour away, a driver for the day beats paying per trip.'),
