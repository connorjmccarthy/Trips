"""Build data/ubud.json: Connor's Ubud extension, 11 to 15 November 2026.

Private. Marked shared:false in data/trips.json, so it does not appear for
anyone the Bali link is sent to. The group flies home on the 11th; this picks up
where their trip stops, with the drive over from Canggu that afternoon.

Still a draft in two places: the hotel is not recorded and there is no flight
home. Both are on the Decisions and Checklists pages.
